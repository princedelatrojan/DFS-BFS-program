## Algorithms Explanation

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It works well for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), where V is the number of vertices.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far along a branch as possible before backtracking. It is commonly used to detect cycles, topological sorting, and finding connected components.

- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) in the case of using recursion or a stack.

## Examples
You can input graphs in adjacency list or matrix format, or modify the example in the code directly. Here are sample inputs:

1. **Example Graph**:  
    Input: `A -> B, A -> C, B -> D, C -> E`

    - BFS Traversal: `A -> B -> C -> D -> E`
    - DFS Traversal: `A -> B -> D -> C -> E`

2. **Weighted Graphs**:  
   Note: These algorithms can be extended to weighted graphs but don't handle weights by default.
